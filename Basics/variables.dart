void main(){
  var name = "Batman";

  // name = 15; //cannot re-assign an integer or anything else, only string can be re-assigned
  name = "Superman";
  print(name);

  //The value of final and const variables cannot be changed
  final age = 25;
  // age = 30;

  const isOpen = true;
  // isOpen = false;

  //But what's the difference between the two and when to use either of them?
